T1 imaging has has bright fat, T2 imaging has bright fat and water (gray matter is the bright part)

The dorsal horn extends to the dorsal root and those are on the posterior side of the spinal cord

The fissure is not part of the grey matter









probably best to run sct on many images and then use some sort of consensus algorithm
    - either before or after running a cleanup of the images

Data preparation:
    - crop the images to the actual data
    - normalize the brightness across slices? (after using a threshold to remove bright spots)
    - restrict segmentation to less damaged regions

Post processing:
    - Hole closing
    - Consensus
    - Output
